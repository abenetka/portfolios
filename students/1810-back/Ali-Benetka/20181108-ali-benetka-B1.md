## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I really had no idea what to expect when I came into Turing. Everything about coding and computers was completely foreign to me.  So foreign that I didn't even grasp what I should be trying to learn. I think that I hoped that by the end of the mod I would be able to write some code. I feel like I definitely accomplished that!

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I feel like I've struggled a lot with the basics of ruby and coding.  I feel like my lack of knowledge coming into the program really held me back, especially in the first couple weeks.  I definitely learned to ask for help sooner, rather than later

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I enjoyed Black Thursday.  I thought the data analytics were super interesting.  I did not like Battleship. I feel like it was way over my head.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
I learned that I can code on my own!

What did you learn from your paired projects?
I think it was really beneficial to have project partners who had much stronger technical skills . I learned a lot just by seeing how they worked through problems and connected all of the pieces.

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I think that I've been a friendly addition to the community.  I feel like I really used the Turing community as a resource to get me through the mod.  I hope I can contribute more and become a resource in the next mod

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I hope to get to know more people outside our mod and be a resource to the new mod.  I don't want anyone to feel like I did in the start of the mod.
